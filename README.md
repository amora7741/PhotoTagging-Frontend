# PhotoTagging-Frontend
This PhotoTagging project acts as the popular puzzle game, Where's Waldo?, only as a web app. The user is presented with 3 characters that they have to find in a scene that is very crowded with other random characters. They are timed and asked for their username if they wish to be placed on a global leaderboard. The purpose of building this project was to get experience on building my own API to handle the character selection and timing processes. Through this, I learned how to pass a JSON webtoken from my Node.js backend to this React.js frontend which contained the time it took for the user to complete the game. I also learned how to store the user info in MongoDB in order to display it on the leaderboard.
